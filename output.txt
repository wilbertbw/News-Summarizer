**Title:** Poilievre dodges questions about repealing national handgun ban

**Summary:**

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre avoided directly answering questions about whether he would repeal the Liberal government's national handgun ban if elected. While he has criticized the government's "assault-style" firearm buyback program, he has been vague about his plans for the handgun ban specifically. He emphasized that most gun crime involves illegally imported firearms from the U.S. and proposed harsher sentences for criminals. Gun control advocates have criticized Poilievre's stance, while some police unions and firearms rights advocates argue the ban only affects legal gun owners and doesn't address the issue of illegal firearms. Liberal Leader Mark Carney has attacked Poilievre's stance on gun control, saying he can't be tough on crime if he's not tough on guns.

**Title:** Mark Carney lays out his plan for 'the biggest crisis of our lifetimes'

**Summary:**

Mark Carney, a Liberal leader, presented his fiscal and spending plan, framing it as a necessary response to a significant crisis involving the U.S. attacking Canada's economy, international trade system restructuring and global economic disruption. His plan involves a $130 billion investment over four years, focusing on defense, infrastructure, and housing, with some tax cuts included. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre criticized the plan as an unaffordable "spending bonanza." The article explores the details of Carney's plan, its projected impact on the deficit, and the contrasting views of Poilievre, who has yet to release a fully costed platform but has pledged similar tax cuts. The piece also considers whether the proposed spending is justified given the global circumstances and Canada's debt situation.

**Title:** NDP wealth tax would raise $94.5B, pay for worker tax cut and health-care improvements

**Summary:** The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, has unveiled a platform centered around a wealth tax aimed at raising $94.5 billion over four years. This revenue is intended to finance substantial new spending, including a tax cut for workers by raising the basic personal amount to $19,500 and improvements to Canada's health-care system. Key health-care initiatives include a universal pharmacare program, increased mental health coverage, and boosting Canada Health Transfers. The NDP acknowledges potential economic volatility and plans a contingency fund. Overall, the NDP platform prioritizes increased investment in social programs and infrastructure over austerity measures. While the commitments will add $48 billion to the federal deficit over the next four years, the NDP defends this increase.

Summary of Article #4
**Title:** Poilievre says costed platform is coming 'soon,' becoming last leader to release a plan

**Summary:**

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is the last major party leader to release a costed platform before the election. While he claims that Canadians already know most of his policies, he promised a platform would be released "soon." The article highlights the significant cost of Poilievre's proposed policies, particularly a middle-class tax cut, and questions how he plans to pay for them. He has proposed measures like defunding the CBC's English service, cutting foreign aid, and cracking down on offshore tax havens, but those may not be sufficient. He contrasts his approach with Liberal Leader Mark Carney and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, criticizing their spending plans and promising to cut costs and balance the budget, though he has not committed to a timeline for doing so.

**Title:** Japan, amid an unprecedented travel boom, is starting to charge tourists more to visit

**Summary:**

Japan is experiencing an unprecedented tourism boom, fueled by a weak yen making it more affordable and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. This surge in visitors has led to overtourism, causing problems such as crowded attractions, increased housing and hotel prices, and damage to cultural sites. To combat these issues, some popular destinations in Japan are implementing a two-tier pricing system, charging tourists higher prices for attractions, restaurants, and other services. Examples include increased fees for climbing Mount Fuji, higher entry fees for Himeji Castle and Junglia Okinawa, and tourist taxes in certain areas. While some visitors haven't noticed significant price differences, the move aims to manage the influx of tourists and its negative impacts on local communities and the environment.
