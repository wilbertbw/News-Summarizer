**Title:** Poilievre dodges questions about repealing national handgun ban

**Summary:**

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has avoided directly answering questions about whether he would repeal the federal government's ban on handguns if elected. While he has criticized the Liberal's "assault-style" firearm buyback program, he has remained vague on his plans for the handgun ban. He argues that most gun crime is due to illegal firearms entering Canada from the U.S. and instead focuses on longer sentences for criminals. Gun control advocates and the Liberal party have criticized Poilievre's stance, arguing that he is not serious about tackling gun violence. Some police unions also feel the ban is ineffective. Data suggests that a large percentage of crime guns seized in Canada are sourced from the U.S., fueling debate over the effectiveness of the ban and potential alternative solutions.

**Title:** Mark Carney lays out his plan for 'the biggest crisis of our lifetimes'

**Summary:**

Mark Carney, a Liberal leader, presented his economic plan centered around addressing what he calls "the biggest crisis of our lifetimes," citing threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. His plan involves significant government intervention to catalyze private investment, with a proposed $130 billion in new measures over four years. This includes tax cuts, investments in defense, infrastructure, and housing. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre criticized Carney's plan as an unaffordable "spending bonanza." The article analyzes the details of Carney's plan, including proposed savings through cuts to "wasteful" spending, and the potential impact on Canada's deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio. It also highlights the contrasting views of Carney and Poilievre on the current economic situation and the appropriate course of action, noting the lack of a fully costed platform from the Conservative Party.

**Title:** NDP wealth tax would raise $94.5B, pay for worker tax cut and health-care improvements

**Summary:** The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, is proposing a wealth tax targeting the wealthiest Canadians to generate $94.5 billion over four years. This revenue would fund a tax cut for workers by raising the basic personal amount to $19,500, improvements to the employment insurance system, and significant investments in healthcare, including universal pharmacare and expanded mental health coverage. The plan anticipates adding $48 billion to the federal deficit over four years but also includes a contingency fund to hedge against economic uncertainty and rejects cuts to public sector and social programs.


Summary of Article #4
**Title:** Poilievre says costed platform is coming 'soon,' becoming last leader to release a plan

**Summary:** With only a week left before election day, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has yet to release his costed platform, making him the last major party leader to do so. While promising its arrival "soon," Poilievre claims Canadians already know much of his plan. He criticizes Liberal Leader Mark Carney's spending promises as "shocking" but has provided limited detail on how he'll fund his own proposals, including a significant tax cut. While aiming to cut costs by defunding the CBC's English service, targeting tax havens, and reducing foreign aid, these measures may not be sufficient to cover his commitments. Poilievre has also pledged to cap government spending and implement a "dollar for dollar" law requiring spending cuts for every new dollar spent. He contrasts his approach with the Liberals' deficit spending, promising to "fix" the books and bring down the deficit, but avoids committing to a specific timeline for balancing the budget. Both the Liberal and NDP leaders have released their platforms, with the Liberals promising significant new spending and the NDP projecting a net increase to the federal deficit.

**Title:** Japan, amid an unprecedented travel boom, is starting to charge tourists more to visit

**Summary:**
Japan is experiencing a massive tourism boom, fueled by a weak yen and the country's appeal. This surge in visitors, while beneficial after the pandemic, is causing problems like overtourism, increased prices for housing and hotels, and disruption of local traditions and environments. To combat these issues, some popular tourist destinations are implementing a two-tiered pricing system, charging tourists more for things like park entry, restaurant meals, and even climbing Mount Fuji. While some visitors haven't noticed significant price differences, the trend is expected to continue as Japan grapples with managing the influx of tourists.
